Figure 1 shows a fitted linear regression for eel internal resistance versus eel length. Below it is a graph for the velocity saturation as the electric field increases.
Figure 2 is the conductivity of ultra pure water. The conductivity is highly temperature dependent. Linear approximation will not give an accurate mathematical model. Below it is the same conductivity centered at ambient temperature. 
The last figure shows current versus displacement where the axial line is defined as the dipole moment vector.
